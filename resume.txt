App Dev Team Manager, Architect, DevOps Practitioner, NoSQL/RDBMS Manager, üëÅ‚ù§Ô∏èPerl! (and yes, I still code!)
My first priority is availability. If systems aren‚Äôt available, value can‚Äôt be delivered. I‚Äôve made a career of being accountable, even for things I did not create. I look out for my team, and that includes making sure my boss remains employed. While I love leading teams, I get just as much fulfillment putting my hands on a keyboard to write a script, drawing out ideas on a dry erase board or presenting in front of a large crowd!
